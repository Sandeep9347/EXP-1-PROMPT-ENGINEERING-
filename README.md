# EXP-1-PROMPT-ENGINEERING-

## Aim: 
Comprehensive Report on the Fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
Experiment: Develop a comprehensive report for the following exercises:

Explain the foundational concepts of Generative AI.
Focusing on Generative AI architectures. (like transformers).
Generative AI applications.
Generative AI impact of scaling in LLMs.

## Algorithm:Algorithm (for this Experiment Write‑Up)

Scope the report: define four sections (Foundations, Architectures, Applications, Scaling).

Collect authoritative references and common definitions; unify terminology (tokens, embeddings, attention).

Synthesize content into concise subsections with diagrams/notes as needed.

Integrate a prompt‑engineering primer with actionable patterns and templates.

Review for clarity, correctness, and academic tone; ensure consistent formatting.

Finalize with an executive Abstract and a practical Engineering Pipeline.


## Output

A structured document explaining Generative AI fundamentals, key architectures (esp. Transformers), real‑world applications across modalities, and how scaling drives LLM capabilities.

Practical prompt‑engineering patterns, mini‑templates, and an evaluation loop to operationalize LLMs.
## Result

The experiment objective is achieved: a comprehensive, structured report on Generative AI and LLMs is produced, including foundational theory, architectural survey, application landscape, scaling dynamics, and hands‑on prompt‑engineering practices suitable for lab submission or future extension.
